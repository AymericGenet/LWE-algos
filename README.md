The Learning With Errors (LWE) problem is a fundamental problem cryptography as it is used in the construction of many cryptographic primitives (e.g. in fully homomorphic encryption). In the recent years there have been several papers that study the complexity of solving LWE.

Albrecht et al. adapted the BKW algorithm to solve LWE and introduced the lazy modulus switching. Later, Duc et al. improved these results by using multidimensional Fourier Transform.

The goal of this project is to implement the existing algorithms and see the difference between the theoretical results and the ones obtained in practice.
